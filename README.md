## Compiling
Several solutions under different configurations (depending on your needs) are contained in the `__Solutions` subdirectory inside the `fullsimpe` folder.

If you simply want to compile the main SimPE application, open the `SimPE.sln` solution and compile.

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2015
- DirectX SDK (optional, *might* be needed by some parts of SimPE)
- PJSE (included as a submodule)
