This is my fork of SimPE (package editor for The Sims 2).

Just got started with compiling the executable and changing the .NET framework version to 4, so nothing to see here yet! I have some extra features and QoL improvements in mind (filter BHAVs by name, add FX wrapper) and I'll update this repo when I have something workable.
